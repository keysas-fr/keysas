# USB virus cleaning station

# üöÄ Main Features

- **File Retrieval**
  - From unsigned/untrusted USB keys (via **keysas-io**)
  - From remote network sources

- **Multi-layer File Scanning**
  - ClamAV antivirus integration
  - YARA rules parsing
  - File extension, type and size checks

- **Digital Signatures**
  - All scanned files and USB devices can be signed
  - Uses **hybrid post-quantum signature** (Ed25519 + ML-DSA-87)
  - Private keys stored in PKCS#8 format
  - Certificates issued and managed by **keysas-admin** internal PKI
  - Each verified file gets a **.krp** report

- **Authentication**
  - Support for user authentication using YubiKey 5 (via **keysas-fido**)

# üîí Security
  This project underwent a **professional security audit** conducted by [Amossys](https://www.amossys.fr/) an external company specialized in cybersecurity. 
  
  Since this audit, all security patches have been applied to the current v2.6. See SECURITY.md for more information.

# Keysas-core

## üß± Architecture Overview

<div align="center">
<img  src ="img/keysas-core-architecture.png"  alt="keysas-core architecture"  width=900px/>
</div>


- Daemons communicate via **abstract sockets** and **raw file descriptors** (Linux only)
- Each daemon adds **metadata** and passes the file to the next
- The last daemon (`keysas-out`) determines if the file is accepted and writes it to the output directory (`sas_out`)
- A detailed **report** is generated for every file


## üîí Daemons Security Hardening

- Run as **unprivileged users**
- Isolated using:
  - **Systemd** security drop-in
  - **Landlock** sandbox
  - **Seccomp** filters (x86_64 & aarch64)
